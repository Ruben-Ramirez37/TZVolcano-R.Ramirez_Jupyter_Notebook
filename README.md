# TZVolcano-R.Ramirez_Jupyter_Notebook
# DBSCAN and BIRCH Clustering Notebook

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the usage of two clustering algorithms: **DBSCAN** and **BIRCH**. These algorithms are commonly used for unsupervised machine learning tasks, particularly for identifying clusters in datasets with varying densities and structures.

## Overview

The notebook provides:

1. **Introduction to Clustering**: A brief explanation of clustering and its importance in data analysis.
2. **DBSCAN Algorithm**: Implementation and visualization of the DBSCAN algorithm, highlighting its advantages and limitations.
3. **BIRCH Algorithm**: Implementation and discussion of the BIRCH algorithm, suited for large datasets.
4. **Comparison of Algorithms**: Analysis and comparison of DBSCAN and BIRCH based on clustering results.
5. **Visualizations**: Graphical representations to illustrate clustering results and algorithm behavior.

## Required Libraries
