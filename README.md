# TZVolcano-R.Ramirez_Jupyter_Notebook
# DBSCAN and BIRCH Clustering Notebook

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the usage of two clustering algorithms: **DBSCAN** and **BIRCH**. These algorithms are commonly used for unsupervised machine learning tasks, particularly for identifying clusters in datasets with varying densities and structures.

## Overview

The notebook provides:

1. **Introduction to Clustering**: A brief explanation of clustering and its importance in data analysis.
2. **DBSCAN Algorithm**: Implementation and visualization of the DBSCAN algorithm, highlighting its advantages and limitations.
3. **BIRCH Algorithm**: Implementation and discussion of the BIRCH algorithm, suited for large datasets.
4. **Comparison of Algorithms**: Analysis and comparison of DBSCAN and BIRCH based on clustering results.
5. **Visualizations**: Graphical representations to illustrate clustering results and algorithm behavior.

## Prerequisites

To run the notebook, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab
- Required Python libraries:
  - `numpy`
  - `pandas`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `scikit-learn`

You can install the required libraries using:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/DBSCAN_BIRCH_clustering.git
cd DBSCAN_BIRCH_clustering
```

2. Open the notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook Ruben_notebook-DBSCAN_and_BIRCH.ipynb
```

3. Execute the cells sequentially to understand and run the clustering algorithms.

## Notebook Structure

1. **Introduction**: Background on clustering algorithms.
2. **Dataset Preparation**: Loading and preprocessing sample datasets.
3. **DBSCAN Implementation**: Steps to implement and visualize DBSCAN clustering.
4. **BIRCH Implementation**: Steps to implement and visualize BIRCH clustering.
5. **Comparative Analysis**: Discussion of results and algorithm performance.

## Outputs

- **Cluster Visualizations**: Plots showing the clusters identified by each algorithm.
- **Performance Metrics**: Key metrics comparing the algorithms.
